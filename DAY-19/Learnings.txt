Your challenge

You need to build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

Which units you choose are down to you, but you could choose one of these:

1. Temperature conversion: users choose Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
2. Length conversion: users choose meters, kilometers, feet, yards, or miles.
3. Time conversion: users choose seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
4. Volume conversion: users choose milliliters, liters, cups, pints, or gallons.
