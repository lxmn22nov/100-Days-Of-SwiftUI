Some Complex DataTypes that group data together.
Understanding the differences between them, especially the use.

- How to store ordered data in arrays?
	- Why does Swift have arrays?

- How to store and find data in dictionaries?
	- Why does Swift have dictionaries as well as arrays?
		* arrays stores data elements sequentially whereas dictionaries stores in key: value pairs.
		* so, rather remembering the indices we can use key to access the data elements. i.e, more convenient.
	- Why does Swift have default values for dictionaries?
		* default value, let us provide a backup value to use for when the key you ask for doesn’t exist.
- How to use sets for fast data lookup?
	- Why are sets different from arrays in Swift?
		* sets are unordered and cannot contain duplicates, whereas arrays retain their order and can contain duplicates.
		* sets don’t need to store your objects in the order you add them, they can instead store them in a seemingly random order that optimizes them for fast retrieval.
- How to create and use enums?
	- Why does Swift need enums?
