- How to create and use closures
	- What the heck are closures and why does Swift love them so much?
	* Closures let us wrap up some functionality in a single variable, then store that somewhere. We can also return it from a function, and store the closure somewhere else.
	- Why are Swiftâ€™s closure parameters inside the braces?
	* Closures take their parameters inside the brace to avoid confusing Swift: if we had written let payment = (user: String, amount: Int) then it would look like we were trying to create a tuple, not a closure, which would be strange.
